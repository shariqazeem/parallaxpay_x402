## 📝 DETAILED SCRIPT

### **0:00-0:25 - THE HOOK** (Landing Page)

**[Screen: Home page, clean browser tab]**

**YOU SAY:**
> "Most AI agent platforms are ChatGPT wrappers with a pretty UI. We built something different: a production-ready ecosystem where AI agents have identity, reputation, and actually pay for their own infrastructure. Watch."

**[Hover over nav bar to show sections: Agents, Oracle, Analytics, Marketplace]**

> "This is ParallaxPay - built on Gradient Parallax and x402. Five interconnected systems working together."

**[Click Connect Wallet - Phantom pops up]**

> "First, wallet-based identity. Every agent is owned by a Solana wallet."

**[Connect wallet]**

---

### **0:25-1:30 - ORACLE AGENT** (65 seconds - THE STAR)

**[Navigate to /oracle page]**

**[Screen: Oracle dashboard loads]**

**YOU SAY:**
> "This is our Market Oracle - it predicts crypto prices for 152 different cryptocurrencies using Gradient Parallax multi-provider consensus."

**[Scroll to show the banner]**

> "Not just Bitcoin and Ethereum - ANY crypto asset. From major coins to DeFi tokens, Layer 1s, meme coins, all 152 supported."

**[Open coin selector dropdown]**

> "Watch this - I can search for any coin..."

**[Type "LSK" or "PEPE" in search]**

> "Lisk, Pepe, whatever you want."

**[Select BNB from dropdown, select 1h timeframe]**

> "Let's predict BNB for the next hour."

**[Click "Predict BNB Price" button]**

**[Screen: Loading animation, then result appears]**

**YOU SAY:**
> "Here's where Gradient Parallax shines. Behind the scenes, it just queried three different Parallax AI providers simultaneously."

**[Scroll to Multi-Provider Consensus section]**

> "Look at this - Provider A voted UP with 75% confidence. Provider B voted UP with 68% confidence. Provider C voted UP at 72%. Final consensus: UP with 100% agreement."

**[Point to consensus strength bar]**

> "This is distributed AI inference in action. No single point of failure, consensus-based reliability."

**[Scroll to x402 cost section]**

> "And the cost? Twelve-hundredths of a cent. $0.0012 for this entire prediction."

**[Click "Cost Comparison" button]**

**[Screen: Cost comparison modal opens]**

**YOU SAY:**
> "Here's why x402 matters. Traditional market data APIs charge $99 per month fixed - whether you use them or not."

**[Point to comparison]**

> "Our Oracle costs $8 per month for 24/7 autonomous operation. That's 92% savings."

**[Close modal]**

> "Perfect for AI agents - pay-per-prediction, no subscriptions, fully transparent."

**[Click "Start Autonomous Mode" if not running]**

> "I can set this to run every 5 minutes automatically, building on-chain reputation over time."

---

### **1:30-2:00 - MARKETPLACE** (30 seconds)

**[Navigate to /marketplace]**

**[Screen: Provider marketplace dashboard]**

**YOU SAY:**
> "This is how we manage Gradient Parallax providers. Right now, we have 3 providers online."

**[Scroll to show provider list with status, latency, reputation]**

> "Each provider shows real-time latency, uptime, and cost. The Oracle automatically uses all available providers for consensus."

**[Point to a provider's metrics]**

> "Latency-based routing, automatic failover if a provider goes down. This is production-grade Parallax integration."

---

### **2:00-2:20 - ANALYTICS** (20 seconds)

**[Navigate to /analytics]**

**[Screen: x402 cost analytics dashboard]**

**YOU SAY:**
> "Every x402 micropayment is tracked here. Total spend, cost per inference, cost over time charts."

**[Scroll to show charts]**

> "Full transparency - you can see exactly where every fraction of a cent went. This is what makes x402 agent-friendly."

**[Point to a transaction]**

> "Click any transaction, it links to Solana Explorer. On-chain, verifiable, transparent."

---

### **2:20-2:45 - AGENT BUILDER** (25 seconds)

**[Navigate to /agents → Click "Build Agent" tab]**

**[Screen: Natural language agent builder]**

**YOU SAY:**
> "Here's the platform thinking - anyone can deploy their own Oracle or custom agent."

**[Scroll to show the builder interface]**

> "Natural language input, test with real Gradient Parallax inference, then deploy. The Oracle you just saw? Anyone can create their own instance tracking different assets."

**[Scroll to "My Agents" tab to show deployed agents]**

> "Agent-to-agent economy. Agents can query other agents, all powered by x402 micropayments."

---

### **2:45-3:00 - THE CLOSE** (15 seconds)

**[Screen: Back to Oracle or home page]**

**YOU SAY:**
> "So that's ParallaxPay. 152 cryptocurrencies. Multi-provider Gradient Parallax consensus. x402 micropayments with 92% cost savings compared to traditional APIs. Autonomous operation. Agent-to-agent infrastructure."

**[Pause]**

> "This isn't a demo - it's production-ready infrastructure that showcases exactly what Gradient Parallax and x402 enable that wasn't possible before."

**[Screen: URL or GitHub repo appears on screen]**

> "Built for the Parallax Eco Track. Thank you."

**[END]**

## 🎥 RECORDING TIPS

### **Before Recording:**
1. Clear browser cache and cookies
2. Close all other tabs/windows
3. Use Incognito/Private mode for clean recording
4. Have wallet already connected with some SOL
5. Test the full flow 3 times before recording
6. Ensure at least 1 Parallax provider is showing as online
7. Use 1920x1080 resolution
8. Record with Loom or OBS at 1080p

### **During Recording:**
1. **Speak clearly and confidently** - no "um" or "uh"
2. **Move mouse smoothly** - no frantic clicking
3. **Pause after each section** - easier to edit
4. **Time yourself** - practice to stay under 3 minutes
5. **Show, don't just tell** - let the UI do the work
6. **No typos on screen** - judges notice everything

### **If Something Goes Wrong:**
- **Don't restart immediately** - pause, collect yourself
- **Worst case:** Record in 3 separate takes (Oracle, Marketplace+Analytics, Builder) then edit together
- **Audio issues:** Record video first, then do voice-over separately

## 🎬 ALTERNATIVE 2-MINUTE VERSION (If Time Constrained)

**If 3 minutes feels rushed, cut these sections:**
- ❌ Skip Marketplace (just mention "provider management" during Oracle section)
- ❌ Skip Analytics (mention "cost tracking" during cost comparison)
- ✅ **KEEP:** Oracle (90 seconds), Agent Builder (20 seconds), Close (10 seconds)

**2-Minute Script:**
- 0:00-0:20 → Hook
- 0:20-1:50 → Oracle (full demo with cost comparison)
- 1:50-2:00 → Close
