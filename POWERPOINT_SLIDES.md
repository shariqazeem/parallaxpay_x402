**For x402 Solana Hackathon Submission**

---

## SLIDE 1: Title Slide (15 seconds)
**Duration**: 0:00 - 0:15

### Visual:
- **Title**: ParallaxPay
- **Subtitle**: AI-Powered Crypto Oracle with x402 Micropayments
- **Built for**: x402 Solana Hackathon - Parallax Eco Track
- **Your name**: Shariq Azeem
- **Screenshot**: Landing page hero section from https://parallaxpay.online

### Speaker Notes:
> "Hi, I'm Shariq Azeem, and I built ParallaxPay for the x402 Solana Hackathon. This is a decentralized AI oracle that predicts cryptocurrency prices using multi-provider consensus and x402 micropayments."

## SLIDE 2: The Problem (20 seconds)
**Duration**: 0:15 - 0:35

### Visual:
- **Title**: The Problem with Traditional Oracles
- **Bullet Points**:
  - 💸 Traditional APIs: $99/month for basic coverage
  - 🔒 Limited to 4-5 major cryptocurrencies
  - 🏢 Centralized providers (single point of failure)
  - ⚠️ No transparency in prediction accuracy

### Speaker Notes:
> "Today's crypto oracles have major problems. They charge $99 per month, only cover Bitcoin and Ethereum, rely on centralized providers, and give you zero transparency. If you want to predict smaller altcoins or DeFi tokens? You're out of luck."

## SLIDE 3: The Solution (25 seconds)
**Duration**: 0:35 - 1:00

### Visual:
- **Title**: ParallaxPay Solution
- **Four Key Innovations**:
  - 🪙 **152+ Cryptocurrencies** - From Bitcoin to meme coins
  - 🤖 **Multi-Provider AI Consensus** - Powered by Gradient Parallax
  - 💰 **x402 Micropayments** - Pay $0.0008 per query (92% savings)
  - 🔄 **Autonomous Operation** - 24/7 automated predictions
- **Screenshot**: Oracle page with coin selector dropdown showing many coins

### Speaker Notes:
> "ParallaxPay solves all of this. You get 152 different cryptocurrencies, multi-provider AI consensus through Gradient Parallax, x402 micropayments at less than a penny per query - that's 92% cost savings - and it runs autonomously 24/7."

  - Multi-provider voting
  - Cost per prediction
  - Confidence score

### Speaker Notes:
> "Let me show you how it works. Here I'm selecting BNB, one of 152 supported coins. Click 'Make Prediction' and watch - three AI providers from the Parallax network analyze the market and vote on the prediction. This is multi-provider consensus in action. The result? A prediction with 85% confidence that cost $0.0008. Traditional APIs would charge you a monthly subscription for just a fraction of this coverage."
