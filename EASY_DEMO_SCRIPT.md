## 📝 The Script (Read naturally, like you're showing a friend):

### Opening (15 seconds)
*[Show landing page]*

> "Hey! I'm Shariq, and I built ParallaxPay for the x402 Solana Hackathon. Let me show you what makes this special."

*[Connect Phantom wallet]*

---

### Main Features (2 minutes, 15 seconds)

#### 1. Oracle Agent (45 seconds)
*[Navigate to /oracle]*

> "So here's the cool part - this is a Market Oracle that can predict **152 different cryptocurrencies**. Not just Bitcoin and Ethereum... I'm talking everything from DeFi tokens to meme coins."

*[Select a coin, maybe Dogecoin or BNB]*

> "Let me pick... Dogecoin. Now watch this."

*[Click "Make Prediction"]*

> "What's happening here? Three AI providers are analyzing the market **right now**, and they vote on the prediction. This is called multi-provider consensus - powered by Gradient Parallax."

*[Wait for prediction to appear, point to the cost]*

> "See that cost? **$0.0008**. Traditional oracle APIs charge you $99 per month for way less coverage. That's the power of x402 micropayments."

*[Click "Start Autonomous Mode"]*

> "And it runs **24/7** automatically. The agent pays for itself, builds its reputation on-chain, and keeps tracking predictions."

---

#### 2. Marketplace (30 seconds)
*[Navigate to /marketplace]*

> "Now, what makes this truly decentralized? Anyone can become a provider."

*[Scroll through provider cards]*

> "These are **real Parallax nodes** running on the network. They compete for requests, and the best ones get rewarded. It's a true AI marketplace."

---

#### 3. Analytics Dashboard (20 seconds)
*[Navigate to /analytics]*

> "Here's where you track everything - your x402 payments, prediction accuracy, cost savings."

*[Point to the graphs]*

> "Look at this cost comparison - **92% savings** compared to traditional APIs. Every request is tracked on Solana."

---

#### 4. Agent Builder (20 seconds)
*[Navigate to /agents]*

> "And here's the platform play - users can **deploy their own agents**."

*[Show agent cards/templates]*

> "Market oracle, blockchain query, or custom agents. One-click deployment, all using x402 payments."

---

#### 5. Transaction History (20 seconds)
*[Navigate to /transactions]*

> "Every single interaction is logged here. Complete transparency - who you paid, when, how much, and what for."

---

### Closing (30 seconds)
*[Back to landing or oracle page]*

> "So to wrap up: **152 cryptocurrencies**, **multi-provider consensus** through Gradient Parallax, **92% cost savings** with x402 micropayments, and **fully autonomous** operation."

*[Pause, look at camera]*

> "This isn't just an oracle - it's infrastructure for the future of AI agents on Solana. Built for the x402 hackathon, ready for production."

*[Smile]*

> "Thanks for watching!"

## 🎬 Recording Tips:

### Camera Setup:
- **Clean background** (or blur it)
- **Good lighting** (face the window or use a lamp)
- **Eye level** (stack some books under laptop if needed)

### Audio:
- **Quiet room** (turn off fans, close windows)
- **Use AirPods** if you have them (better mic than laptop)
- **Speak clearly** but naturally

### Pacing:
- **Breathe!** Don't rush
- **Pause between sections** (easier to edit)
- **If you mess up** - just pause, take a breath, and restart that sentence
- **Smile when you talk** - it shows in your voice

### Screen Recording:
- **Use QuickTime** or **OBS Studio**
- **Hide your dock** (Command + Option + D)
- **Close extra tabs/apps** (clean desktop)
- **Full screen the browser** (Command + Control + F)

## 💡 If Something Goes Wrong:

- Fill time naturally

**Forgot what to say?**
- Pause, take a breath
- Say it in your own words
- Don't worry about being perfect!

## 🔥 Bonus: Alternative Quick Opening (if you're confident)

> "What if I told you that you can predict **any** cryptocurrency - not just Bitcoin - for **less than a penny**, using **multiple AI providers** that vote on the answer, and the whole thing runs **autonomously 24/7** on Solana? That's ParallaxPay. Let me show you."

*[Then proceed with the demo]*

**Good luck! You got this! 🚀**
